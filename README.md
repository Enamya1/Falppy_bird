# Falppy_bird
This repository contains a Flappy Bird clone developed using the Godot Engine and written in GDScript. The game faithfully recreates the classic Flappy Bird experience, where players control a bird navigating through a series of pipes by tapping to make it fly. The objective is to avoid obstacles and achieve the highest score possible.
